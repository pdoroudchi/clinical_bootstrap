In this personal project I:

- Performed external concordance study of follow-on companion diagnostic without a reference standard
- Simulated clinical performance data with do-loops and generated confusion matrices using PROC SQL
- Applied bootstrapping with PROC SURVEYSELECT to derive nonparametric performance statistics
- Generated confidence intervals with PROC UNIVARIATE and automated reporting via PROC PRINT
