In this personal project I:

- Replicated a clinical performance dataset with a do-loop and created a confusion matrix using PROC SQL
- Applied PROC SURVEYSELECT for bootstrapping and calculated performance metrics with PROC SQL
- Generated confidence intervals with PROC UNIVARIATE and utilized PROC PRINT to output results
